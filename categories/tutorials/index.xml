It may sound bizarre but the mathematical concept of fractals opens the realm towards this intricating infinity. This strange geometry exhibits the same or similar patterns irrespectively of the scale. We can see one fractal example in the image above.
The fractals may seem difficult to understand due to their peculiarity, but that's not the case. As Benoit Mandelbrot, one of the founding fathers of the fractal geometry said in his legendary TED Talk:</description></item><item><title>Animated polar plot with oceanographic data</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/animated-polar-plot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 09:56:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/animated-polar-plot/</guid><description>The ocean is a key component of the Earth climate system. It thus needs a continuous real-time monitoring to help scientists better understand its dynamic and predict its evolution. All around the world, oceanographers have managed to join their efforts and set up a Global Ocean Observing System among which Argo is a key component. Argo is a global network of nearly 4000 autonomous probes or floats measuring pressure, temperature and salinity from the surface to 2000m depth every 10 days.</description></item><item><title>Emoji Mosaic Art</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/emoji-mosaic-art/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 19:11:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/emoji-mosaic-art/</guid><description>A while back, I came across this cool repository to create emoji-art from images. I wanted to use it to transform my mundane Facebook profile picture to something more snazzy. The only trouble? It was written in Rust.
So instead of going through the process of installing Rust, I decided to take the easy route and spin up some code to do the same in Python using matplotlib.
Because that's what anyone sane would do, right?</description></item><item><title>Draw all graphs of N nodes</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/draw-all-graphs-of-n-nodes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 09:05:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/draw-all-graphs-of-n-nodes/</guid><description>The other day I was homeschooling my kids, and they asked me: &amp;ldquo;Daddy, can you draw us all possible non-isomorphic graphs of 3 nodes&amp;rdquo;? Or maybe I asked them that? Either way, we happily drew all possible graphs of 3 nodes, but already for 4 nodes it got hard, and for 5 nodes - plain impossible!
So I thought: let me try to write a brute-force program to do it! I spent a few hours sketching some smart dynamic programming solution to generate these graphs, and went nowhere, as apparently the problem is quite hard.</description></item><item><title>Matplotlib Cyberpunk Style</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/matplotlib-cyberpunk-style/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 20:26:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/matplotlib-cyberpunk-style/</guid><description>1 - The Basis Let's make up some numbers, put them in a Pandas dataframe and plot them:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 3, 9, 5, 2, 1, 1],
'B': [4, 5, 5, 7, 9, 8, 6]})
df.plot(marker='o')
plt.show()
2 - The Darkness Not bad, but somewhat ordinary. Let's customize it by using Seaborn's dark style, as well as changing background and font colors:</description></item><item><title>Matplotlib for Making Diagrams</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/mpl-for-making-diagrams/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 12:57:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/mpl-for-making-diagrams/</guid><description>Matplotlib for diagrams This is my first post for the Matplotlib blog so I wanted to lead with an example of what I most love about it: How much control Matplotlib gives you. I like to use it as a programmable drawing tool that happens to be good at plotting data.
The default layout for Matplotlib works great for a lot of things, but sometimes you want to exert more control.</description></item><item><title>Create Ridgeplots in Matplotlib</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/create-ridgeplots-in-matplotlib/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 09:50:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/create-ridgeplots-in-matplotlib/</guid><description>Introduction This post will outline how we can leverage gridspec to create ridgeplots in Matplotlib. While this is a relatively straightforward tutorial, some experience working with sklearn would be beneficial. Naturally it being a vast undertaking, this will not be an sklearn tutorial, those interested can read through the docs here. However, I will use its KernelDensity module from sklearn.neighbors.
Packages import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.</description></item><item><title>Create a Tesla Cybertruck That Drives</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/create-a-tesla-cybertruck-that-drives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 13:35:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/create-a-tesla-cybertruck-that-drives/</guid><description>My name is Ted Petrou, founder of Dunder Data, and in this tutorial you will learn how to create the new Tesla Cybertruck using Matplotlib. I was inspired by the image below which was originally created by Lynn Fisher (without Matplotlib).
Before going into detail, let's jump to the results. Here is the completed recreation of the Tesla Cybertruck that drives off the screen.

A word before we get started&amp;hellip; Although a beginner can follow along with this guide, it is primarily meant for people who have at least a basic knowledge of how Matplotlib's plotting functionality works.</description></item><item><title>Custom 3D engine in Matplotlib</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/custom-3d-engine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 09:05:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/custom-3d-engine/</guid><description>Matplotlib has a really nice 3D interface with many capabilities (and some limitations) that is quite popular among users. Yet, 3D is still considered to be some kind of black magic for some users (or maybe for the majority of users). I would thus like to explain in this post that 3D rendering is really easy once you've understood a few concepts. To demonstrate that, we'll render the bunny above with 60 lines of Python and one Matplotlib call.</description></item><item><title>Creating the Warming Stripes in Matplotlib</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/warming-stripes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 09:21:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/warming-stripes/</guid><description>Earth's temperatures are rising and nothing shows this in a simpler, more approachable graphic than the “Warming Stripes”. Introduced by Prof. Ed Hawkins they show the temperatures either for the global average or for your region as colored bars from blue to red for the last 170 years, available at #ShowYourStripes.
The stripes have since become the logo of the Scientists for Future. Here is how you can recreate this yourself using Matplotlib.</description></item><item><title>How to Contribute</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/how-to-contribute/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 21:37:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/how-to-contribute/</guid><description>Matplotblog relies on your contributions to it.
