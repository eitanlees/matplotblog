Introduced by Prof. Ed Hawkins they show the temperatures either for the global average or for your region as colored bars from blue to red for the last 170 years, available at #ShowYourStripes.
The stripes have since become the logo of the Scientists for Future. Here is how you can recreate this yourself using Matplotlib.</description></item><item><title>Using Matplotlib to Advocate for Postdocs</title><link>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/using-matplotlib-to-advocate-for-postdocs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 12:43:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/using-matplotlib-to-advocate-for-postdocs/</guid><description>Postdocs are the workers of academia. They are the main players beyond the majority of scientific papers published in journals and conferences. Yet, their effort is often not recognized in terms of salary and benefits.
A few years ago, the NIH has established stipend levels for undergraduate, predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees and fellows, the so-called NIH guidelines. Many universities and research institutes currently adopt these guidelines for deciding how much to pay postdocs.</description></item></channel></rss>
