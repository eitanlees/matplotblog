Yet, 3D is still considered to be some kind of black magic for some users (or maybe for the majority of users). I would thus like to explain in this post that 3D rendering is really easy once you've understood a few concepts. To demonstrate that, we'll render the bunny above with 60 lines of Python and one Matplotlib call.</description></item></channel></rss>
