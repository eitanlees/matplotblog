Or maybe I asked them that? Either way, we happily drew all possible graphs of 3 nodes, but already for 4 nodes it got hard, and for 5 nodes - plain impossible!
So I thought: let me try to write a brute-force program to do it! I spent a few hours sketching some smart dynamic programming solution to generate these graphs, and went nowhere, as apparently the problem is quite hard.</description></item></channel></rss>
